Here's some python help if you want to use python to link midi devices.

You may need to, in terminal:

```bash
pip3 install rtmidi
```

OR

```bash
pip install rtmidi
```

python or python3 midi thru code:
```python
import rtmidi_python as rtmidi

midi_inSide = rtmidi.MidiIn()

midi_inSide.ignore_types( False, False, False ) #read sysx data

midi_outSide = rtmidi.MidiOut()

def callback(message, time_stamp):
	print message, time_stamp
	midi_outSide.send_message(message)

#the two lists
#lists all midi in ports starting with 0
for port_name in midi_inSide.ports:
	print port_name
#lists all midi out ports starting with 0
for port_name in midi_outSide.ports:
	print port_name

#use values from the two lists above
midi_inSide.open_port(1)    #starts with 0, midi keyboard plugged into computer 	RECEIVES HERE
midi_outSide.open_port(8)   #also starts with 0, the actual iridescentCoconutSynth device  SENDS HERE
midi_inSide.callback = callback #actually assigns the midi thru with function callback
```
